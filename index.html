Loads and Dynamics Engineer, Engines <br>

<p>
Prior to working at Blue Origin, I was a project engineer at <a href="https://www.ata-e.com/">ATA Engineering, Inc.</a>, an engineering services firm.
</p>
<p>
Prior to working at ATA, I was a developer for <a href="https://www.altair.com/optistruct/">OptiStruct</a>, a finite-element analysis and optimization solver belonging to the Hyperworks suite owned by <a href="https://www.altair.com/">Altair</a>.
</p>
<p>
Prior to working at Altair, I did my graduate studies at the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My doctoral research there was supported by the US army led VLRCOE (Vertical Lift Research Center of Excellence) and pertained to the field of Aerospace structures and materials with focus on the modeling and design of rotor blades. I was advised by the ever-friendly <a href="http://dhodges.gatech.edu/">Dr. Hodges</a>. I am also an alumnus of the Institute of Technology Bombay, from where I graduated with a B.Tech degree in 2009.

<b><u>Acknowledgement</u></b> To all the men and women focused on advancing science and it's associated disciplines. My engineering education has provided me several 
opportunities to do research, and I have realized how hard it can be to think beyond what surrounds us. Prof. Richard Dawkins, captures it spot on in his book, 'The God Delusion': "Unaided human intuition, evolved and schooled in this world, even finds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us that a cannonball and a feather, given no air friction, would hit the ground at the same instant when dropped from a leaning tower. That is because in this world, air friction is always there. If we had evolved in vacuum, we would expect a feather and a cannonball to hit the ground simultaneously. We are evolved denizens of this World, and that limits what we are capable of imagining. The narrow window of our vision permits us, unless we are especially gifted or peculiarly well educated, to see only this world."</p>
